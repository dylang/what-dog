* Requires Node 4 or newer.
* Powered by [What-Dog](https://www.what-dog.net/), a free service provided by Microsoft.

* This node module was not created by Microsoft.
* I would consider this module "for testing only" - I do not recommend using in a production system.
* Microsoft: I made this because I am a fan of the technology. If there are any problems, or you want to use this package name, I'm happy to discuss.
